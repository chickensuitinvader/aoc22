"""Determine overlaps in 1D

Part I
------
Each line describes assignments for a pair of elves.
Want to count the number of assignments where one assignment lies entirely within the other

Part II
-------
Same structure.
Want to count number of overlaps (partial and whole)

Approach: Overlaps can be detected by endpoint comparisons only
